1. A Simple AJAX Example - Program your first AJAX request using JavaScript. You'll use AJAX to load HTML into a div tag on a web page.
2. GET and POST - Learn about the two most common methods for sending requests to a web server. What is the difference between the two and when to use GET, when to use POST?
- GET. Used for most requests. Browser uses the GET method whenever it requests a new web page, CSS file, image, and so on. Use GET when you want to "get" something from the server.
- POST. Used frequently with web forms to send data to store in a database. Use POST when sending data that will store, delete or update information from a database.
